# Quizzo
<h2>This is a Quiz web application made using Django framework by me.</h2><hr>
<p>In this web app I have created twenty questions ans their options and correct answers in a list. 
User first land on landing page. From there he/she can navigate to quiz page where questions are placed in neat, reponsive designed page. 
User can select answers and submit at the end of the page using button. 
At the back end these answers are checked and the score is returned to user at front end using sweet alert.</p>
